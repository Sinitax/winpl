winpreload
==========


Ideology
--------

Winpreload is a non-invasive way of modifying window properties for
windows created by a program through the use of LD_PRELOAD. This
enables the user to set properties such as _NET_WM_WINDOW_TYPE to
start the window as floating and adjust its position. Parameters
are passed to winpreload via environment variables, which are
prefixed with 'WINPRELOAD+'.
